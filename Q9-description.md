For my creativity challenge I took on the challenge of getting inspiration for getting a new mustache style to add to the gallery. I leveraged question 8 and 9 to complete this. In question 8 I implemented an axios request to get a random mustache image from the Unsplash api. Then to satisfy question 9, I upload that random image to the openAI ChatGPT and ask it to come up with a title for the mustache style. Additionally I make another request for the description of the mustache. This allows the admin to get a photo, title, and description to add to the style gallery. Additionally, I added a "save inspiration" button that takes that image, converts it to a JPG and saves it to the file system much like if the admin were to have added the image themselves through the add style routes.
